# Animated-Multi-line-chart using D3

Animated Multi-line chart containing Energy Consumption per Capita in Million BTUs per person for 6 countries (BRICS – Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and USA) for a 11 year period from 2000 to 2010.

# Introduction to D3:

D3 = Data-Driven Documents D3 is a Javascript library for creating data visualizations. Data is provided by you, the user. Documents are web-based documents (HTML, SVG,…) that can be rendered by a web browser. D3 does the driving by connecting data to documents. D3 is entirely open source and freely available at Github (https://github.com/mbostock/d3/)

D3 loads data into memory, binds data to elements within the document, transforms the visual properties of those elements based on data, and transitions elements based on user input.

# Download

Installers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be downloaded at http://brackets.io/.

The Linux version has most of the features of the Mac and Windows versions, but is still missing a few things. See the Linux wiki page for a list of known issues and to find out how you can help.

# Usage

Chrome Browser (rather than Firefox or Internet Explorer or Safari or any other browser) is used.

By default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple "Getting Started" content. You can choose a different folder to edit using File > Open Folder.

# To run the code:

When you launch Brackets, there is a Live preview button on the top right that looks like a ~. Clicking this button automatically launches Chrome Browser where you can instantly witness the results of the HTML, CSS, Javascript, or D3 code.
